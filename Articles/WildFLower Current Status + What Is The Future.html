                    <strong>WildFlower</strong> is an upcoming game currently in development by <strong>VoidCode Studios. </strong>
                    This story-driven adventure requires players to solve puzzles, acquire items, and uncover more about themselves, their powers, and their heritage.
                    The story follows a young vampire girl who awakens with no memories, only a strange craving for a mysterious substance and an uncontrollable surge of powers. 
                    As she interacts with others and learns more about herself, she begins to unravel the secrets of her past, the world around her, 
                    and the powers she must learn to control in order to reach the place where she can find the answers she seeks.

                <p> The development of the game began in 2024 but has unfortunately been paused for nearly four months. 
                    This pause was due to me, the lead developer, being sick and unable to work on the game. While the illness was not life-threatening, 
                    it made it difficult to focus on game development and other projects. 
                    <br> 
                    Although I haven't fully recovered yet, I am determined not to let this game die before it's even released. 
                    I have decided to resume work on the game in the future, as I am almost recovered and ready to re-enter the game development workflow.
                    For now i have decided to work on a new small game project to get back into the workflow and to get back into the game development world.
                    once i have a base for this game i will announce it on the <a class="URL" href="/News.html"><strong>News</strong></a> page.
                    <br> 
                    &nbsp;
                </p> 
                <p> While my games don't yet have a large community, I am incredibly grateful for the people who have shown interest and are patiently waiting for there releases. 
                    <br> Thank you to all the readers, 
                    and I will be posting more updates on game progress in the <a class="URL" href="/News.html"><strong>News</strong></a> section in the future.
