                    <strong>Project Oxygen Depleted</strong> is an upcoming strategy-based survival game currently in development.
                    Set in a post-apocalyptic world where the surface has become uninhabitable, 
                    humanity is forced to live underground. As the leader of a group of survivors, 
                    your task is to guide your people through the perilous depths of the earth, 
                    rebuilding civilization and ensuring survival in an environment that is as dangerous as it is fragile.

                <p> 
                    In this game, players will be responsible for constructing a thriving subterranean society. 
                    You'll dig caverns, build critical infrastructure, and manage essential resources like food, 
                    water, and, most importantly, oxygen. The underground is full of challenges: resource scarcity, 
                    environmental hazards, and the constant threat of unknown dangers. Every decision you make will impact your people's survival 
                    and the future of humanity.

                <p>  
                    Your leadership will be tested as you balance technological advancement with the immediate needs of your citizens. 
                    As you progress, you'll unlock new abilities and technologies, but your progress won't come without difficulty. 
                    Defending your underground civilization from environmental dangers and other threats is just as important as managing your resources.

                    Now that I have fully recovered, I’m excited to announce that I am working on <strong>Project Oxygen Depleted</strong> full-time. 
                    Development is moving forward smoothly with no delays, and I’m committed to bringing this project to life with great attention to detail. 
                    I plan to share all progress, updates, and behind-the-scenes details through the official Discord, 
                    where the community can get involved and stay up-to-date.

                <p> 
                    Though the game is still in its early stages, I’m thrilled about the potential of <strong>Project Oxygen Depleted</strong> and look forward to building a vibrant, 
                    engaging world. I’ll continue sharing updates through the <a class="URL" href="/News.html"><strong>News</strong></a> section of the site and on the <a class="URL" href="https://discord.gg/VTx2pG5ZS5" target="_blank"><strong>official Discord.</strong></a>

                <p> 
                    Thank you to everyone who has shown interest in the game so far. 
                    Your support and patience have been invaluable, and I’m excited to share more with you as development progresses.
                    This was all I wanted to share for now. More updates are coming soon. I’ll see you all next year!
